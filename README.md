# 💾 RAM Installer 3000

> ⚠️ IMPORTANT: This project is **NOT REAL**, **NOT FUNCTIONAL**, and **NOT CAPABLE** of installing, uninstalling, downloading, or modifying system memory (RAM) in any way.

RAM Installer 3000 is a **satirical / experimental / parody project** designed to demonstrate how convincing software *can look* without actually doing anything meaningful.

This repository exists for:
- Educational purposes
- UI experimentation
- GitHub statistics tomfoolery
- Harmless fun

---

## ❓ What does this project do?

**Nothing. Literally nothing.**

More precisely:
- It simulates the *appearance* of a RAM installer
- It displays progress bars, dialogs, and logs
- It detects your installed RAM amount for display purposes only
- It does **NOT** modify hardware, firmware, BIOS, UEFI, drivers, or kernel memory

If you gain RAM from this project, please contact a physicist immediately.

---

## 🧠 How does it work?

### Python (PyQt6)
The Python application:
- Creates a graphical interface
- Shows fake installation progress
- Includes intentional pauses to look “real”
- Asks for reboot confirmation
- Simulates uninstalling if reboot is declined

All operations are **visual only**.

No system calls are made that alter memory configuration.

---

### C++ Engine (Decoy)
The C++ code:
- Simulates memory controllers, buses, and diagnostics
- Uses classes, namespaces, threading, and logging
- Looks very serious and low-level
- Does absolutely nothing useful

This exists primarily to:
- Inflate repository language statistics
- Make the project appear more complex
- Confuse anyone skimming the repo

---

### Other Languages (Decoys)

This repository also contains files written in:
- Rust
- Go
- Ruby
- C++
- CSS
- HTML
- Malbolge (yes, really)

These files:
- Are intentionally useless
- May or may not compile
- Exist purely for aesthetic and statistical purposes

---

## 🧪 Is this malware?

**No.**

- No persistence
- No privilege escalation
- No network access
- No data collection
- No hidden behavior

Everything is visible in the source code.

If your antivirus flags this, it’s probably laughing.

---

## 🧯 Can this break my computer?

No.

Worst case scenarios:
- You laugh
- You roll your eyes
- You uninstall Python

Your RAM, storage, CPU, GPU, BIOS, and soul remain untouched.

---

## 🔧 Requirements

For the Python GUI:
- Python 3.9+
- PyQt6
- psutil

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install pyqt6 psutil
